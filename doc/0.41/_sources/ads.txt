Advertisements
==============

Advertisements or ads are the main resource on the Sellside API. You can
create, update and delete them, change the status and get a list of your ads.
Through the API you only have access to your own ads. Ads from other
advertisers are not accessible to you.

.. _ad-fields:

Fields
------

Each ad has a unique identifier by which the ad can retrieved and a set of
required and optional fields which are listed below:

Images
------

Each ad can contain up to eight (8) images which can be provided by the caller
as a set of URLs. Marktplaats will download the images and if they meet the
requirements then they will be stored on Marktplaats servers in several sizes
so that they can then be used by the user.

An image is valid if it is in JPG, PNG or BMP format and is smaller than 8MB
in size. GIF images are not supported and images larger than 726x726 px are
being scaled down.

The images will be shown in the order they are provided. The first image is
shown in search results and it is the main image on the item page on
Marktplaats.

.. index:: image objects
.. _ad_image_objects:

Image Objects
"""""""""""""

When an ad is created for the first time the caller provides the images as a
list of URLs or unique identifiers returned by :ref:`post_image`. Normally,
you would use either URLs or the unique identifiers but not both although
there is no requirement to do so.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "images": [
        {
            "src": "http://www.ourshop.com/img/brother_fax_big.jpg",
            "src": "b2c11184b33bdd3e12a1f46152d37a89.jpg"
        },
        ...
     ]

The images are then queued to be downloaded by Marktplaats and checked. When
fetching the ad the next time the server will add some attributes which
indicate the status of the image download:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "images": [
        {
            "src": "http://www.ourshop.com/img/brother_fax_big.jpg",
            "status": "OK",
            "dateLastUpdated": "2012-09-10T13:11:05Z",
            "links": {
                "50x70": "http://i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_abc.jpg",
                "120x180": "http://i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_def.jpg",
            }
        }
        ...
     ]

The server adds a ``status`` field indicating the status of the download. The
status is either **OK** (image was successfully downloaded), **PENDING**
(image is scheduled to be downloaded) or **FAILED** if the image was not found
or invalid.

If the ``status`` is **OK** then a **links** map is added which contains links
to copies on the Marktplaats servers of the uploaded image in various sizes.
The dimensions are specified as *max width* x *max height*.

The server also adds the ``dateLastUpdated`` field which specifies the time
the image was last updated.

.. note::

    The caller can provide all the attributes added by the server since
    they will be ignored.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "images": [
        {
            "src": "http://www.ourshop.com/img/brother_fax_big.jpg",
            "status": "OK",
            "dateLastUpdated": "2012-09-10T13:11:05Z",
            "links": {
                "50x70": "http://i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_abc.jpg",
                "120x180": "http://i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_def.jpg",
            }
        }
        ...
     ]


.. index:: attributes

.. index:: shippingOptions
.. _ad_shippingOptions:

==============      =========================================================================================================================================================
type                *SHIP* or *PICKUP*. *SHIP* means the item can be delivered to the buyer. *PICKUP* means the item can be picked up.

.. note::

    Although it is not mandatory, it is highly advised that the caller provides a valid postcode
    in the pickUpLocation field when sending a shipping option of type *PICKUP*.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "shippingOptions": [
        {"type": "SHIP", "cost": 0, "time":"2d-5d"},
        {"type": "PICKUP", "pickupLocation":"1097DN"}
     ]

.. index:: buyItNowEnabled
.. _ad_buyItNowEnabled:

buyItNowEnabled
"""""""""""""""

Enabling *Buy It Now* functionality allows advertiser to sell items directly via Marktplaats.
In order to use 'Buy It Now' Sellside API users need to have the *Buy It Now* permission.

When **buyItNowEnabled** field is set to true, :ref:`ad_paypalEmail` field must contain a valid email address,
:ref:`ad_priceType` must be **FIXED_PRICE** and :ref:`ad_price` must be greater than 1. If **buyItNowEnabled** field
is not set or set to false :ref:`ad_paypalEmail` is ignored.

.. index:: paypalEmail
