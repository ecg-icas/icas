Campaigns
=========

A Campaign is a group of ads, sharing a campaign budget. With campaigns, it is possible to control spending for this entire list of ads and,
in one go, start/stop advertising with the entire list of (active) ads.
Campaigns can have their own budgets, both daily and total. If these are not set, the total budget will automatically be set to "UNLIMITED" and the
daily budget will be set to a default value.

For the time being, we only allow multiple campaigns for sellers of Kleinanzeigen. This means for all other markets,
we allow only 1 campaign per seller, effectively grouping _all_ the ads in that one campaign. 
To make transitions to use campaigns easier, we will ensure that each (new or existing) seller already has a campaign, and if the
seller has ads, these will be part of the campaign. 

The first campaign to be created, either explicitly or by us ensuring there is one, will also become the `default campaign`. This
means that whenever ads are created through API without specifying a campaign Id, the ad will become part of this `default campaign`.
For markets where only one campaign per seller is allowed at the moment, this campaign is also the default.

You can get your campaign by calling :ref:`get_campaigns` or :ref:`get_campaign_id`. Campaign budgets can be modified by using 
:ref:`put_campaign_id_budgets`, and controlling campaign status can be done by :ref:`put_campaign_id_status`. We expect to 
add more campaign functionality in the future.

.. _campaign_vendorId:

vendorId
""""""""

Any non-empty string with a maximum length of 64 characters. Should be unique
per customer. Can either be set when creating a campaign or when updating an
existing campaign. However, once set, it can no longer be modified. When fetching an
existing campaign which does not have a **vendorId**, the field is omitted.
Inserting a new campaign with the same vendorId will still fail if you
already have a campaign with that vendorId, regardless of its status. See :ref:`vendor_ids` for more explanation.

.. index:: title

title
"""""

A string of maximum 64 characters. This is purely a label for the seller, to potentially differentiate between
multiple campaigns easier. This is not shown to buyers anywhere. This field will be omitted if the campaign does
not have a title set.

.. index:: isDefault
.. _campaign_isDefault:

isDefault
"""""""""

A boolean indicating whether this campaign is the default campaign for the seller or not. If so, any ads that will
be placed without campaignId, will be added to this default campaign. Whenever we create a campaign under water for
new sellers having no campaigns yet, these campaigns will automatically become the default campaign.
