Campaign Targeting
==================

.. _campaign-targeting:

Campaigns allow you to target specific groups of buyers. Buyers not in these target groups will typically not
see any ads from this campaign (some exceptions apply). Currently, only geographic targeting is supported but we
are looking to add other forms of targeting. See :ref:`post_campaign` for more details.

Geo Targeting
"""""""""""""

Geo targeting allows you to specify one or more (circular) areas in the targeting criteria of a campaign
to have the ads of that campaign only be shown to buyers located in that geographical area.

Region Targeting
""""""""""""""""

For tenants that use regions (currently KJCA), you can specify one or more regions in the targeting criteria of a campaign
to have the ads of that campaign only be shown to buyers located in that region.

TODO: how will regions and geos interplay? Should we allow only using one at a time in a campaign? (and then targeting area is a union of all geos OR all regions)
If we allow both to be used, then we might need to change the defaults (right now default is nationwide which means they would need to adjust either both or none)
