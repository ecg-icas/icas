Campaign Targeting
==================

Campaigns allow sellers to target specific groups of buyers. Buyers not in these target groups will typically not
see any ads from this campaign (some exceptions apply). Currently, only geographic targeting is supported but we
are looking to add other forms of targeting.

Geo Targeting
"""""""""""""

Geo targeting allows sellers to specify one or more circular areas in the targeting criteria of a campaign
to have the ads of that campaign only be shown to buyers located in that geographical area.

Region Targeting
""""""""""""""""

For tenants that use regions (KJCA), sellers can specify one or more regions in the targeting criteria of a campaign
to have the ads of that campaign only be shown to buyers located in that region.
