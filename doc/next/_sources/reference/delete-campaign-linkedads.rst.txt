DELETE /campaign/{id}/linkedAds
===============================

It is possible to remove a :ref:`single <delete-single-linked-ad>` linkedAd or :ref:`multiple <delete-multiple-linked-ads>` linkedAds from a campaign in one go. Removing the linkedAd from a campaign does not remove the ad from your inventory; it only takes the ad offline for that particular campaign.

Removing a single linkedAd:

Removes a linkedAd from the campaign. If successful, the server responds with `HTTP 204`. TODO: yes or no (silently ignore nonexisting links): If the linkedAd does not exist, the server responds with `HTTP 404`.
