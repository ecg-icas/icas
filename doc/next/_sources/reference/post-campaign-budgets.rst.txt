Updates the budgets limits for the specified campaign (see :ref:`Campaign Budgets Object <campaign-budgets-object>` for more). If the ``id`` is invalid, i.e., not a positive integer, the server returns *400 Bad Request.*
Any previous budgets limits on the specified campaign will be overwritten. Any budget type which is not included in the payload, will be set to **-1 (Unlimited**).

Setting a budget on a campaign in a ``DELETED`` state is not allowed.
