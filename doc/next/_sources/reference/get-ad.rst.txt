GET /ad v5
----------

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_ro`` or ``console_ro``

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.ad.list-v5+json, application/json``

This URL returns a single page of ads for the current user, the total size of the
result set matching the filter criteria and next page token if additional pages
are available.

.. warning::

	This call is only compatible with :ref:`categories_v2` and must only
	be used with the other :ref:`categories_v2_compatible_endpoints`. Otherwise,
	the attributes may not be recognized or editable.

The number of ads returned can be limited with the ``limit`` parameter.
The ``nextPageToken`` parameter could be provided to fetch next page if available.

The ``status`` parameter returns only ads with the given status. The default
is to return only ads with status **ACTIVE**.

The ``orderBy`` and ``direction`` parameters control the sort field and
direction. By default results are ordered by created date.

The ``titleKeywords`` parameter is case-insensitive and will include only ads
which contain the given keyword in their title.

The ``changedSince`` parameter can be used to retrieve only ads that have
:ref:`ad_dateLastUpdated` >= ``changedSince``. The ``changedSince`` value must be a
valid `ISO 8601`_ UTC date which usually lies in the past but cannot lie in
the future.

.. note::

	This call returns only creative part of the ad. CPC and budget are managed
	separately as part of the campaign.

Caching all ads for a user
--------------------------

If an application needs to keep a cache of the entire set of ads for a user
then it should perform the following steps:

1. Fetch all ads by using ``limit`` and ``nextPageToken`` until all
ads have been retrieved. No filters should be used.

2. Retrieve updates by using ``changedSince``, ``limit`` and ``nextPageToken``.
No additional filters should be used. ``changedSince`` should be set to a value
a somewhat before (e.g. 1 min) of ``dateLastUpdated`` of the last modified ad.

Due to the nature of this system retrieving updates as described in step 2
will always return at least the ad that was modified last. Also, the API can
currently not guarantee that all updates are retrieved when ``changedSince``
is set to ``dateLastUpdated`` of the last modified ad. That's why you should
use ``dateLastUpdated`` - 1 minute. To determine whether an ad has changed
compare the ``dateLastUpdated`` value.

Unless you have a very small set of ads (< 10) do not retrieve all ads every
time since this will not give you decent performance and also puts unnecessary
load on the system.

Example

.. include:: ../examples/get-ad-v5-example.rst

.. _get_ad_v3:

GET /ad v3
----------

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_ro`` or ``console_ro``

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.ad.list-v3+json, application/json``

This URL returns a list of ads for the current user and the total size of the
result set matching the filter criteria.

.. warning::

	This call is only compatible with :ref:`categories_v2` and must only
	be used with the other :ref:`categories_v2_compatible_endpoints`. Otherwise,
	the attributes may not be recognized or editable.

The number of ads returned can be limited with the ``limit`` parameter.
The ``offset`` parameter allows to skip some ads and together with ``limit``
allows for pagination.

The ``status`` parameter returns only ads with the given status. The default
is to return only ads with status **ACTIVE**.

The ``orderBy`` and ``direction`` parameters control the sort field and
direction.

The ``titleKeywords`` parameter is case-insensitive and will include only ads
which contain the given keyword in their title.

The ``changedSince`` parameter can be used to retrieve only ads that have
:ref:`ad_dateLastUpdated` >= ``changedSince``. The ``changedSince`` value must be a
valid `ISO 8601`_ UTC date which usually lies in the past but cannot lie in
the future.

The ``changedSince`` parameter should only be combined with ``limit`` and
``offset``. Filtering by ``status`` and ``titleKeyword`` may be used but
``orderBy`` and ``direction`` cannot be changed since this would break the
pagination.

The ``remainingBudget`` parameter can be used to retrieve only ads whose remaining
budget (:ref:`ad_totalBudget` - :ref:`ad_spentBudget`) is below a given threshold.
The ``remainingBudget`` value must be an absolute integer number (e.g. **123**) or a
percentage (e.g. **10%**).

The ``startDate`` and ``endDate`` parameters can be used to define a period. The
values for both should be valid dates represented as 'yyyy-MM-dd', and the ``endDate``
should represent a date equal or after the ``startDate``. The ads returned have had
activity in this period. Note that ads which were live during this period but did
not recieve a single click, impression or urlClick, and did not have any updates
in this period, will be filtered out.

.. note::

    The fields :ref:`ad_pageNumber` and :ref:`ad_suggestedCpcForPageOne` are
    currently expensive to compute. If you do not need their values consider
    excluding them to speed up the response. To exclude the fields add the
    following parameter to the request URL. ::

        ?_exclude=pageNumber,suggestedCpcForPageOne
