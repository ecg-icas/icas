============================

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_rw`` or ``console_rw``

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.campaign.budgets-v2+json``

 * - Content-Type
   - ``application/sellside.campaign.budgets-v2+json``

Creates (if they don't exist) or updates the budgets limits for the specified campaign (see :ref:`Campaign Budgets Object <campaign-budgets-object>` for more). If the ``id`` is invalid, i.e., not a positive integer, the server returns *400 Bad Request.*
The call is idempotent; any previous budgets limits on the specified campaign will be overwritten.
All types of budgets (``Daily``, ``Monthly``, ``Total``) should be sent while updating,
or an empty object, in which case all types of budgets will be created **-1 (Unlimited**). Partial update are not allowed.

Setting a budget on a campaign in a ``DELETED`` state is not allowed.

.. include:: ../examples/put-campaign-budgets-example3-v2.rst


The ``spent`` values in each budget type are **read-only**.
