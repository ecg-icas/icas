This URL requests a new report for the current user. Creating the report may
take a long time which depends on the number of ads and the requested date
range. Therefore you

1. Request a new report with `POST /report/detail` which returns a unique id
2. Poll `GET /report/detail` until the id is in the result
3. Fetch the report with `GET /report/detail/{id}`
