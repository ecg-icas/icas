PUT /campaign/{id}/linkedAds
============================

It is possible to add/override a :ref:`single <single_linkedad>` linkedAd or :ref:`multiple <list_linkedad>` linkedAds in one go.
If the campaign already has a linkedAd with the same adId, the existing linkedAd will be overriden with
the provided one.
It is not possible to have multiple linkedAds in one campaign with the same adId.

A single linkedAd has the following request model structure:

.. include:: ../examples/campaign-ad-request.rst

.. _single_linkedad:

Adding/overriding a single linkedAd:
-------------------------------------

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_rw`` or ``console_rw``

 * - Content-Type
   - ``application/sellside.campaign-linkedads-v1+json; charset=utf-8``

Adds a linkedAd to the campaign or overrides ones with same adIds. If successful, the server responds with `HTTP 200`.

.. include:: ../examples/put-campaign-linkedads-v1-example.rst

.. _list_linkedad:

Adding/overriding multiple linkedAds:
--------------------------------------

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 80

 * - Scope
   - ``api_rw`` or ``console_rw``

 * - Content-Type
   - ``application/sellside.campaign-linkedads-list-v1+json; charset=utf-8``

Adds multiple linkedAds to the campaign. Overrides existing linkedAds with same adIds. If successful, the server responds with `HTTP 200`.

.. include:: ../examples/put-campaign-linkedads-list-v1-example.rst


In the example above, the first linkedAd has no overrides, it merely links the ad to the campaign; the second linkedAd overrides the ``cpc`` value that the campaign may have as a setting; the third linkedAd overrides any campaign budgets with ones specific for that ad.
