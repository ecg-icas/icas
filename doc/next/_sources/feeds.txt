XML Feeds
=========
XML feeds are the way for users to handle repetitive asynchronous bulk uploading of ads.
When a user is eligible for feed usage the user can configure an HTTP(s) URL through
:ref:`post_feed_config` or the frontend to make iCAS, once a day, attempt to download an
XML file. The contents of this XML file need to adhere to the XSD available for sellers
at :ref:`get_feed_xsd`.

Once a day we pull the XML file configured for all appliccable users.
We treat the provided XML file as the desired list of ads the user wants to have live.
Any ads not present (referred to by **vendorId**) in the XML file will be paused during
the import of this file.

The (mandatory) **vendorId** field in the XML file is there to let us know, for consecutive imports, which
ads are the same. This results in allowing us to update an existing ad with the same **vendorId** instead
of creating a new ad. **vendorId** is mandatory and, as specified in the XSD, unique for each ad in the
XML file.

.. warning::
   There is still an **externalId** field in the XSD, this field is replaced by **vendorId**.
   Please update your XML to reflect this change. This makes naming consistent between feeds and sellside API.
   The **vendorId** field in the feeds has the same meaning and constraints as the **vendorId** field in the
   sellside API.


Errors
------
:ref:`get_feed_import` shows the overview of imported feeds of the user, and
:ref:`get_feed_import_id_detail` can be a good source of information on possible errors
or warnings on ads, such as missing mandatory attributes or too low CPC etc. If your XML
does not pass the XSD at :ref:`get_feed_xsd` this is where you will see why.
After the XSD validates, it will handle the ads inside it separately, and a failure on one ad
will then not impact other ads.


Character encoding & Line terminators
-------------------------------------
Feeds are expected to be in UTF-8 encoding without Byte Order Marker (BOM) with Unix (LF) line terminators.
Feed files with a BOM marker and/or different line terminators (e.g. CRLF on Windows) will not be processed.


Whitelisting
------------

As mentioned in :ref:`overview_image_downloads` our outgoing IPs for downloading images (also the ones
defined in the feed) should be whitelisted. We also download the XML file itself using these IPs.


Example XML
-----------

.. code-block:: xml

Scenario's & Questions
----------------------

Below are some common asked-for scenarios and questions with their explanations/answers.

- Feed file cannot be fetched

When a feed file cannot be fetched, nothing will change on the user's ads.
It's as if the import didn't happen. Since the file represents the desired
list of ads to be live, we won't do anything if we can't get the file -
we cannot read a change in the desired situation.

- Feed file is empty

When a feed file is empty, all ads of the user will be paused. An empty
file means the desired list of ads to be live is empty, so all active ads
are paused. Note that this also means that all ads which are in statuses
BUDGET_REACHED or DAILY_BUDGET_REACHED are also paused.

- Feed file contains only new ads

In the spirit of the feed file being the desired set of ads to be live for
a user, all currently active ads (including ads in BUDGET_REACHED or DAILY_BUDGET_REACHED)
will be paused and the supplied ads will be created (with status ACTIVE).

- Editing ads through frontend / API

In the spirit of the feed file being the desired set of ads to be live for
a user, all ads will be (re)set to their representing feed values. This means
you can see changes made throuh API or frontend undone after a successful feed import.

- XML does not validate against XSD

If the fetched XML filed does not validate against the XSD there will not be any changes
to your ads. Existing ads will remain unchanged and no new ads will be created.

- How to validate XML against XSD

Next to various online capabilities where you can provide both your XML and XSD files,
a way to check quickly and locally is to use a tool called xmllint. With this tool
you can use our XSD downloaded from :ref:`get_feed_xsd` to test whether your feed is
working before you let iCAS fetch it using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  xmllint --debug --noout --schema /path/to/admarkt1.0.xsd /path/to/yourfeed.xml

For small chunks of XML you can use online validators as well, such as `<http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/>`_ or `<https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html>`_. Note that these have a
limit on the size of the XML you can check, but it should be more than enough to be able
to test correctness of your structure.
