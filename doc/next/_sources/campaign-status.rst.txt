Campaign Status
===============

Each campaign can be in one of the following states. Some of the states can be set by the user, others
are set by the system or by customer service.

User Controlled States
----------------------

.. index:: pair: Campaign Status; ACTIVE
.. _campaign_status_active:

ACTIVE
""""""

The campaign is active and its linked ads are shown on the site.

.. index:: pair: Campaign Status; PAUSED
.. _campaign_status_paused:

PAUSED

The campaign is not active and its linked ads are not shown on the site. The campaign can be re-activated.

.. index:: pair: Campaign Status; DELETED
.. _campaign_status_deleted:

DELETED
"""""""

The campaign has been deleted by the user and cannot be re-activated. Its linked ads are also not shown on site.


System States
-------------

.. index:: pair: Campaign Status; BUDGET_REACHED
.. _campaign_status_budget_reached:

BUDGET_REACHED
""""""""""""""

One or more of the campaign's budgets have been reached and its linked ads are not shown on site.
In case of recurring budgets, like Daily or Monthly budgets, the budgets will be periodically reset
and the campaign will become active again. If a campaign is both ``BUDGET_REACHED`` and ``PAUSED``,
it will be shown as ``PAUSED``.
