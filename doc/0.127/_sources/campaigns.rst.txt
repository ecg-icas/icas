Campaigns
=========

A Campaign is a group of ads, sharing a campaign budget. With campaigns, it is possible to control spending for this entire list of ads and,
in one go, start/stop advertising with the entire list of (active) ads.
Campaigns can have their own budgets, both daily and total. If these are not set, the total budget will automatically be set to "UNLIMITED" and the
daily budget will be set to a default value.

For the time being, we allow only 1 campaign per seller, effectively grouping _all_ the ads in that one campaign. 
To make transitions to use campaigns easier, we will ensure that each (new or existing) seller already has a campaign, and if the
seller has ads, these will be part of the campaign. 

You can get your campaign by calling :ref:`get_campaign` or :ref:`get_campaign_id`. Campaign budgets can be modified by using 
:ref:`put_campaign_id_budgets`, and controlling campaign status can be done by :ref:`put_campaign_id_status`. We expect to 
add more campaign functionality in the future.
