:ref:`get_ad_v5` is quite similar to :ref:`get_ad_v3` and :ref:`get_ad_v4`, except for some changes in the :ref:`ads` and an addition of a ``nextPageToken`` field in the response struct.
This ``nextPageToken`` replaces the usage of the 'offset' parameter and allows the caller to paginate through a large list of ads more efficiently.
In essence, it contains encoded information on where the returned result ended, so it can serve as additional filters in the call for the next result set, making
that call more efficient. For the very first page, a pageToken should not be provided. For any following page, callers should use the exact same request with an added `pageToken` parameter.
The value for the ``pageToken`` parameter for page N+1 is the ``nextPageToken`` field in the response of your call to fetch page N. 
When a response does not contain a ``nextPageToken`` you have reached the last page of results and there are no more to fetch.

Note the difference in naming between response field `nextpageToken` and request parameter `pageToken`.

:ref:`get_ad_v5` will return the ads in the response in version V5, similar to :ref:`get_ad_id_v5`. See :ref:`ad-fields` for the documentation on the fields.

pageToken        string           Encoded information on where the previous page ended, send this along with the same request to get the next page of results. Scales better than offset.

orderBy          string           Orders the result set by the given field. Default value is DATE_CREATED. See :ref:`order_by`.
direction        string           Determines the direction of the sort. Should be one of [ASCENDING, DESCENDING]. Default is ASCENDING.
changedSince     date             Returns ads which have ``changedSince`` >= ``dateLastUpdated``.
remainingBudget  string           Returns ads whose remaining budget is below a certain value (absolute number or a percentage).
startDate        string           Determines the startDate of the period to select ads with activity for.

categoryIds      list of ints     List of category id's to filter by. Only leaf category id's are useful, since ads can only be placed in leaf categories.
_include         string           Comma-separated-list of fields to include. Optional, default is all fields.
_exclude         string           Comma-separated-list of fields to omit. Optional, default empty.

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.ad.list-v4+json, application/json``


.. note::

    The only backwards-incompatible change from :ref:`get_ad_v3` is with respect to the usage of ``startDate`` and ``endDate`` parameters.
    Namely, ads which were live during this selected period but did not receive a single click, impression, urlClick, etc (any visitors activity) will be filtered out.
    **This does not include ads which received updates anymore.**

    In addition, the response contains a field **statusReasons**. This field is currently used to indicate the reason why a certain ad might be set to a certain status by our system.
    This could be due to, for example, an action (like new website domain approval) pending from the user, which is a mechanism used to prevent account takeovers from setting the website URL to a malicious one.

.. _get_ad_v3:

GET /ad v3
----------

.. warning::

    :ref:`get_ad_v3` is now officially deprecated and scheduled for removal on July 15th 2020. Please move to use :ref:`get_ad_v4`. If you were not
    using ``startDate`` or ``endDate`` parameters in your calls the output will be the same in :ref:`get_ad_v4`.

   - ``application/sellside.ad.list-v3+json, application/json``

The number of ads returned can be limited with the ``limit`` parameter.
The ``offset`` parameter allows to skip some ads and together with ``limit``
allows for pagination.

The ``status`` parameter returns only ads with the given status. The default
is to return only ads with status **ACTIVE**.

The ``orderBy`` and ``direction`` parameters control the sort field and
direction.

The ``titleKeywords`` parameter is case-insensitive and will include only ads
which contain the given keyword in their title.

The ``changedSince`` parameter can be used to retrieve only ads that have
:ref:`ad_dateLastUpdated` >= ``changedSince``. The ``changedSince`` value must be a
valid `ISO 8601`_ UTC date which usually lies in the past but cannot lie in
the future.

The ``changedSince`` parameter should only be combined with ``limit`` and
``offset``. Filtering by ``status`` and ``titleKeyword`` may be used but
``orderBy`` and ``direction`` cannot be changed since this would break the
pagination.

The ``remainingBudget`` parameter can be used to retrieve only ads whose remaining
budget (:ref:`ad_totalBudget` - :ref:`ad_spentBudget`) is below a given threshold.
The ``remainingBudget`` value must be an absolute integer number (e.g. **123**) or a
percentage (e.g. **10%**).

The ``startDate`` and ``endDate`` parameters can be used to define a period. The
values for both should be valid dates represented as 'yyyy-MM-dd', and the ``endDate``
should represent a date equal or after the ``startDate``. The ads returned have had
activity in this period. Note that ads which were live during this period but did
not recieve a single click, impression or urlClick, and did not have any updates
in this period, will be filtered out.

.. note::

    The fields :ref:`ad_pageNumber` and :ref:`ad_suggestedCpcForPageOne` are
    currently expensive to compute. If you do not need their values consider
    excluding them to speed up the response. To exclude the fields add the
    following parameter to the request URL. ::

        ?_exclude=pageNumber,suggestedCpcForPageOne

Caching all ads for a user
--------------------------

If an application needs to keep a cache of the entire set of ads for a user
then it should perform the following steps:

1. Fetch all ads by using ``limit`` and ``offset`` until all
ads have been retrieved. No filters should be used.

2. Retrieve updates by using ``changedSince``, ``limit`` and ``offset``. No
additional filters should be used. ``changedSince`` should be set to a value a
somewhat before (e.g. 1 min) of ``dateLastUpdated`` of the last modified ad.

Due to the nature of this system retrieving updates as described in step 2
will always return at least the ad that was modified last. Also, the API can
currently not guarantee that all updates are retrieved when ``changedSince``
is set to ``dateLastUpdated`` of the last modified ad. That's why you should
use ``dateLastUpdated`` - 1 minute. To determine whether an ad has changed
compare the ``dateLastUpdated`` value.

Unless you have a very small set of ads (< 10) do not retrieve all ads every
time since this will not give you decent performance and also puts unnecessary
load on the system.
