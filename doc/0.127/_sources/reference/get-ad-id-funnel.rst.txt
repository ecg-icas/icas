This URL returns performance predictions such as number of impressions, clicks
and url clicks for a given ad and cpc value.

The endpoint also returns information regarding the current page on which the
ad is displayed (``pageNumber``) and the required cpc value which would place the ad on page
one (``averageCpc``). If ``cpc`` is greater than ``maxCpc`` then this ad does not perform well
enough to be placed on page one.

If the performance of an ad cannot be predicted yet, the server returns a
``204 No Content`` response with an empty body. This can happen when, for
instance, the ad is the only one in a category and no reference ads exist yet
from which to derive a performance prediction.

The ``averageCpc`` field in the response marks the required cpc value to place the ad on page one in its category.
We will rename this field in a future version of the endpoint to make this clearer.
