Release Notes
=============

This section gives insight on what our current and previous releases contain.

Feb 2023: 'Campaigns & Micros'
------------------------------

Synopsis
""""""""

* changing wording of ``cpc`` to ``bid``, Functionality has not changed.
* For bid, budgets & spent values we now communicate in micros: 1 cent == 10000 micros. Fields representing a monetary value will now also be named accordingly, mentioning whether they represent a value in cents or micros. This will result in fields like ``bidMicros`` and ``amountCents``. The change into micros is also represented in the category data, where the interval of allowed values is defined.
* Introduced campaigns, campaign ID not (yet) mandatory while placing ads. Campaigns have their own daily/total budgets. Since currently only 1 campaign is allowed per user, the budgets from this campaign effectively act on all ads.
* Moved price and related fields into a struct.

Removed Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* removed externalID, use vendorID instead.
* removed currency, 1 country == 1 currency anyway. Monetary values always in local currency.
* removed pageNumber & suggestedCpcForPageOne: In the desktop-era the majority of traffic was generated by leaf category browse actions, which lead to the introduction of the "suggested cpc for page one". Today, traffic from additional sources like search actions and personal recommendations have become dominant. As these traffic sources use different ranking methods, the relevance of the "suggested cpc for page one" has diminished.
* Use the V2 version of /metrics/ads and /metrics/report to get spent and bid values in micros too, to avoid confusion. V1 is deprecated.
* User endpoint updated to V4, this adds 1 new field to V3 (which added 1 field to V2). Older versions than V4 are deprecated.

Ads

 Be sure to check the budgets of that campaign as a default campaign will have unlimited budget.
 Deleting a campaign is currently not allowed.
