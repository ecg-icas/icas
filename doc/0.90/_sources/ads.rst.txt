Advertisements
==============

Advertisements or ads are the main resource on the Sellside API. You can
create, update and delete them, change the status and get a list of your ads.
Through the API you only have access to your own ads. Ads from other
advertisers are not accessible to you.

.. index:: images
.. _ad_images:

Images
------

Each ad can contain up to eight (8) images which can be provided by the caller
as a set of URLs. iCAS will download the images and if they meet the
requirements then they will be stored on iCAS servers in several sizes
so that they can then be used by the user.

An image is valid if it is in JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format and is smaller than 8MB
in size. Images larger than 1024x1024 px are being scaled down.

The images will be shown in the order they are provided. The first image is
shown in search results and it is the main image on the item page on
Marktplaats.

.. index:: image objects
.. _ad_image_objects:

Image Objects
"""""""""""""

When an ad is created or updated the caller provides the images as a list of
image objects which contain only the source url.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "images": [
        {
            "src": "http://www.ourshop.com/img/brother_fax_big.jpg",
        },
        ...
     ]

The images are then downloaded by iCAS and the server adds additional
fields which describe the status of the download.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "images": [
        {
            "src": "http://www.ourshop.com/img/brother_fax_big.jpg",
            "status": "OK",
            "dateLastUpdated": "2012-09-10T13:11:05Z",
            "links": {
                "50x70": "//i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_abc.jpg",
                "120x180": "//i.marktplaats.nl/image23434_def.jpg",
            }
        }
        ...
     ]

The server adds a ``status`` field indicating the status of the download. The
status is either **OK** (image was successfully downloaded), **PENDING**
(image is scheduled to be downloaded) or **ERROR** if the image was not found
or invalid.

If the ``status`` is **OK** then a **links** map is added which contains
*protocol agnostic* links to copies on the iCAS servers of the uploaded image
in various sizes. The dimensions are specified as *max width* x *max height*.

The server also adds the ``dateLastUpdated`` field which specifies the time
the image was last updated.

.. note::

    The caller can provide all the fields added by the server since
    they will be ignored.

.. index:: attributes
.. _ad_attributes:

""""""""""

An optional list of :ref:`user_defined_attributes`.

.. index:: shippingOptions
.. _ad_shippingOptions:

shippingOptions
"""""""""""""""

Whether shipping options are disabled/optional/mandatory for an ad is configured per category, see :ref:`category_config_v2`.

.. list-table::
 :widths: 20 30 50
 :header-rows: 1

 * - Field
   - Mandatory
   - Description

 * - `type`
