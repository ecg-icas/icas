Categories V1
=============

.. warning::

    Version 1 is deprecated and will be removed after September 2015.

The category tree contains all the categories available for placing ads. Each
category has a unique id, a parent id, a label and a list of child categories.
Also, for each category the minimum and maximum cpc values as well as the
minimum and maximum total budgets are specified.

The API allows you to get the entire category tree or just parts of it
depending on your use case. We advise you to get only the parts that you need
at any given moment and not cache the information since it may be subject to
change.
