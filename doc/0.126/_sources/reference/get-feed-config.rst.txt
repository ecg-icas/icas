This URL returns the feed configuration of the current user.

A user can update his or her ads by describing them in an XML document, called **feed**.
The system reads all user feeds once per day and synchronizes ads in the system.

The feed configuration object contains an ``enabled`` field. It is **true** when the current user
has enabled feed publication and **false** otherwise. When feed publication is enabled, the
feed configuration object contains a field ``feedUrl`` which contains the configured
feed url for the current user.

.. note::

    Access to the feed functionality may be granted per user by the Customer Service.
    Unauthorized user requests to the this endpoint will result in **401 Unauthorized**
    responses.
