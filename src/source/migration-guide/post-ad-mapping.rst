- **Price**: ``price`` and ``originalPrice`` map to ``price.amountCents`` and ``price.originalAmountCents`` respectively. The value was already in cents so there is no need for conversion.
- **CPC**: ``cpc`` is replaced by ``bidMicros``. This requires a conversion of the values to a micros unit, and stringifying, when supplying them.
- **Budget Fields**: ``daiyBudget`` and ``totalBudget`` map to ``budgets.daily.limitMicros`` and ``budgets.total.limitMicros`` respectively. ``dailySpent`` and ``spentBudget`` map to ``budgets.daily.spentMicros`` and ``budgets.total.spentMicros``. **Beware that they are now mandatory to supply.** All fields require conversion of the values to a micros unit (and should be stringified) in the payload. The limits can also be ``UNLIMITED``.
- **Shipping Cost**: ``cost`` is renamed to ``costCents``. The value was already in cents so there is no need for conversion.
- **Removed** field(s): ``currency,`` ``allowPayPal``. ``externalId`` is marked as deprecated, please use ``vendorId`` instead.
