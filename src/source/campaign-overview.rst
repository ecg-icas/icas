.. _campaign_overview:

Overview
========

Campaigns allow you, the seller, to group your ads together, having shared budgets, same targeting rules, and other components. You can create separate campaigns to run ads in different locations or using different budgets.

Reporting, as well as status management, can also be done on the level of campaigns, instead of individual ads. It is possible to pause a campaign, resulting in all ads in the campaign to be taken offline. When a campaign reaches one of its :ref:`campaign_budgets`, all ads in that campaign will be taken offline. When budget becomes available again, all ads in the campaign will come
online again.

.. _components:

Components
----------

A campaign consists of several components:

========================= ================================================
Component                 Short description
========================= ================================================
:ref:`campaign_id`        The unique reference to the campaign
:ref:`campaign_title`     User-provided title
:ref:`campaign_vendorid`  Unique reference for the seller to the campaign
:ref:`campaign_status`    Status of the campaign
:ref:`campaign_linkedads` Ads in this campaign
:ref:`campaign_budgets`   Budgets of this campaign
:ref:`campaign_targeting` Targeting options of this campaign
:ref:`campaign_cpc`       CPC for all ads in this campaign
========================= ================================================


.. _campaign_id:

Campaign ID
"""""""""""
Unique reference to the Campaign, needs to be omitted in a POST action. Generated by us,
and needed for certain GET/PUT actions to modify the campaign and its properties.


.. _campaign_title:

Campaign title
""""""""""""""
The title of the campaign, provided by you. This makes it easier for you to distingish between your campaigns. Your campaign titles are not visible to your ad viewers.

.. _campaign_vendorid:

Campaign vendor ID
""""""""""""""""""
A per-seller unique identifier to identify the campaign. This is provided by you.
Can either be set when creating a campaign or when updating an
existing campaign. However, once set, it can no longer be modified. When fetching an
existing campaign which does not have a **vendorId**, the field is omitted.
Creating a second campaign with a vendor ID already used by the seller is not allowed.
Since this also functions as a unique identifier (for the seller) it is possible to fetch the
campaign by vendor ID using :ref:`get_campaign_vendorid`.

.. _campaign_status:

Campaign status
"""""""""""""""

The status the campaign currently has. It can be any value from the list in :ref:`campaign_status_overview`. You can set only one
of the user-controlled states *ACTIVE*, *PAUSED* or *DELETED*. *DELETED* is a final state.

.. _campaign_linkedads:

Campaign linked ads
"""""""""""""""""""

A *linkedAd* defines an ad in the context of a particular campaign, with possible overrides for certain campaign-level properties (budgets, cpc, ...).
This construction makes ads into mere data containers, and can allow for an ad to be linked to multiple campaigns (future plans).
A campaign without linkedAds is an empty campaign, which is a valid scenario. See :ref:`campaign_linkedads_overview` for more info.

.. _campaign_budgets:

Campaign budgets
""""""""""""""""

Campaigns can have multiple types of budgets, see :ref:`campaign_budgets_overview`. Budgets are seen as limiting factors, meaning that, as soon
as one runs out, all ads of this campaign will be taken offline until budget(s) becomes available.

.. _campaign_targeting:

Campaign targeting
""""""""""""""""""

Campaigns can have targeting criteria, allowing you some customization on the target group of customers that your ads will be shown to. See :ref:`campaign_targeting_overview` for more info.

.. _campaign_cpc:

Campaign CPC
""""""""""""

You can set a fixed CPC for all ads in this campaign. CPC has impact on where the ad(s) will be shown (higher or lower in the results page, etc).
This CPC will be charged for every click on ads in this campaign. The campaign CPC can be overridden for individual ads in the campaign using :ref:`campaign_linkedads_overview`.
