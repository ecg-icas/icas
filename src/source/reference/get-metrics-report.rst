GET /metrics/report

 * - Scope
   - ``console_ro`` or ``api_ro``

 * - Accept
   - ``application/sellside.metrics.ad-hit-v1+json`` or ``application/sellside.metrics.ad-session-v1+json``

Returns a performance report for a selected date period, per ad.
The report contains statistics for performance events like impressions, clicks, url clicks, emails for all ads **which have had performance-related activity**.

The ``Accept`` header depends on the choice of the scope for the metrics. A scope for a metric defines the aggregation level at which that metric is defined â€” hit, session, or user.
Conceptually, user is the highest level scope and hit is the lowest level scope. For example, ``clicks`` counts the number of unique clicks that ad received when the scope is `hit`,
whereas it counts the number of unique sessions with clicks when the scope is `session`. If you are migrating away from our deprecated reporting endpoints, and want to keep the numbers in the same units, then you should use the `hit` level.

We plan to extend support for user-level scoped metrics if there is demand for it.
