This URL returns a single campaign with the given ``vendorId``.

If the campaign does not exist or does not belong to the user the server returns
**404 Not Found**. If the ``vendorId`` is bigger than 64 characters the
server returns **400 Bad Request**.

The vendorId is unique for a user; It is not possible for a single user to create
multiple campaigns with the same vendorId (even if other campaigns are in status ``DELETED``).
